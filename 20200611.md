### June 11, 2020(Thr.)
It was raining today.  
I joined the zoom meeting with our clients in the morning.  
And I had a meeting for design review and release schedule in the afternoon, too.  
I was assigned to be in charge of a certain project troubleshooting suddenly.  
I confirmed the specs and committed a modified sql.  
  
I was a bit busy today.
