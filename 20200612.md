It was raining today, too.  
I had weekly meetings at 1:00 pm.  
The purpose of this meeting is to share the status of each project.  
I talked to my team about my project.  
  
After that I reviewed the design document which a certain company's employee created.  
  
My work wasn't that busy today.
