I will restart my English diary for self-development.<br>
It's hard to continue,right?<br>
But I wanna be able to speak English and I wanna use it for my work, so I will continue.<br>
I became a mentor this year.<br>
To put it simply, This work is to support a new employee.<br>
It's said my score is 90. I decided to do my best.<br>
