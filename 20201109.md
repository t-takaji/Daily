I will restart my English diary for self-development.
It's hard to continue,right?
But I wanna be able to speak English and I wanna use it for my work, so I will continue.
I became a mentor this year.
To put it simply, This work is to support a new employee.
It's said my score is 90. I decided to do my best.
