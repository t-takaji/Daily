Hear me,  
Today I was complimented.  
A certain project was found a bug.  
So we had to write a modified program.  
A man was assigned to deal with this bug.  
But he couldn't do it.  
So his project manager asked me to modify the bug.  
I could answer appropriately.  
He told me "Great for you".  
I will do my best tomorrow!
